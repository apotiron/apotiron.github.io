## Gender and Diversity in Computer Science and Engineering: Perspectives from Sociocultural Studies and Ethics
[Artificial Intelligence Program](https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/)

**Course Description:**
This course explores how values shape science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on issues related to gender and racial biases. In particular, we will focus on algorithmic systems and the biases they incorporate as a result of poor design. To grasp how algorithmic systems can perpetuate patterns of gender and racial injustice, it is critical to grasp how values and prejudices are sneaked, often inadvertently, into the design of AI tools. We will shed light on these issues by discussing works in the feminist philosophy of science and more recent feminist data studies. After understanding how algorithmic systems can be ethically controversial, we will discuss opportunities for a fair, just, and more inclusive ethical design.

**Responsibility:**
- Teaching in a formal way (Lecture) while leaving space for students' questions ‚ùì
- Evaluating students‚Äô assignments and final exams

**Semester:** Summer 2023
