I'm Alien ðŸ‘½, coming from the microbiology planet to visit the philosophy of science universe.

Throughout my PhD, I relied on my experience in the lab on microbial communities to address philosophical issues. Through microbial ecology and microbiome research case studies ðŸ¦ , I challenged existing philosophical frameworks and developed new approaches to data, diversity measurement, and causality. I have adopted a practice-oriented approach to philosophy where scientific practice can inform philosophical inquiry and vice versa.

Continuing this work, I am very happy to be part of the [Microbiome research and race in the 'Local South'](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/history-and-philosophy-of-the-life-sciences/microbiome-research-and-race-in-the-local-south) project led by Abigail Nieves Delgado. I aim to understand better the interplay of races in biological sciences and the microbiome in Latin America and propose solutions to practitioners to avoid racism.
