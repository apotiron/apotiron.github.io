I'm Alien ðŸ‘½, coming from the microbiology planet to visit the philosophy of science universe.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the philosophy of the life sciences at the [Freudenthal Institute](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/freudenthal-institute), Utrecht University. My research has so far focused on philosophical issues raised by microbiome studies. Continuing this work, I am very happy to be part of the [Microbiome research and race in the 'Local South'](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/history-and-philosophy-of-the-life-sciences/microbiome-research-and-race-in-the-local-south) project led by Abigail Nieves Delgado. I aim to understand better the interplay of races in biological sciences and the microbiome in Latin America and propose solutions to practitioners to avoid racism.

Throughout my PhD, I relied on my experience in the lab on microbial communities to address philosophical issues.
- **Theories and Observation**: By investigating amplicon sequencing, a widely used approach by scientists, I have suggested a [novel definition of samples](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-024-09962-0), a category overlooked by philosophers compared to data.
- **Measurement**: Pursuing the investigation of this approach and its use in microbial diversity assessment, I have indicated that measuring diversity in microbial ecology and microbiome studies is particularly challenging due to issues such as microorganismal isolation and fluctuating classification. Traditional philosophical measurement accounts are inadequate, making a model-based account the most suitable approach to address these challenges. 
- **Worldviews**: By taking a more historical approach to microbiome studies, I have argued that the dominant Newtonian worldview, characterized by reductionism and determinism, is inadequate for understanding complex phenomena. Instead, I have advocated for a shift towards a systems worldview exemplified by the work of [Serguei Winogradsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Winogradsky), a founder of microbial ecology, that prioritizes holism and complex causality. 
- **Causality**: By examining scientific practice in microbiome studies, I have challenged current philosophical accounts of causation, such as interventionism and functionalism. Instead, I have proposed that the inferentialist theory is a more suitable framework for understanding causal relationships. This theory emphasizes evidential pluralism and context dependency and requires scientists to articulate their epistemic context and goals clearly.
