  abstract = {This paper aims to reconsider the relationship between scientific data and the world. Data are usually considered as direct “screenshot” of the world. They are thus supposed to be fixed, context-independent and objective. In particular, in the context of modern Big Data-based science, data are supposed to “speak for themselves”. Metabarcoding is one method of modern microbiology that generates such data. Its principle is the DNA sequencing and analysis of a single gene, called a barcode. DNA sequences are thus central in those methods and passed from the world (the microorganisms) to the computer. During the transformation, choices are made which impaired the view of the fixed and objective screen shot. A sequenced barcode uniquely identifies the species of microorganisms in the community of a given environment. Thus, metabarcoding data are highly contextual where “context” is supposed to refer to a particular place, time and/or conditions. Thus, in metabarcoding, the path between data to knowledge is less straightforward than expected. This paper uses metabarcoding as a case study to develop a new understanding of the relationship between scientific data and the world. Metabarcoding generates millions of sequences, and is considered a data-centered method. Hence, I use the data journey framework developed by Leonelli in her book Data-centric biology: a philosophical study (2016). First, I assess what constitutes data in metabarcoding. I argue that DNA sequences become data not by acquiring the ability to travel but by acquiring the ability to sustain empirical claims. Sequences do so by increasing their reliability, through the interactions between environmental DNA and scientific technologies and through bioinformatics steps performed on sequences retrieved from sequencing platforms. Second, I evaluate how metabarcoding data can sustain empirical claims. I argue that the biological relevance of these data and conclusions made from them are better understood if we conceive the environment at the same epistemic level as the organism. Biology is usually conceived as gathering data and conclusions about individual organisms or even population. Yet, metabarcoding is about gathering data about a given environment. Projects such as the Earth Microbiome Project, in developing an ontology of studied environments that is more or less inclusive depending on the level of the taxonomy tend to integrate this shift.},

  title = {Human gut microbiomes research: what are the benefits of the mechanistic causal account?},

  abstract = {This paper develops this working hypothesis: to focus on the interventionist framework of causal explanation in human gut microbiomes research underestimates the role of mechanistic account of causal explanation and it risks overlooking relevant therapeutics avenues. Human gut microbiomes studies are a recent and growing research field both in microbiology and in philosophy. Recently, causal explanation in this field have been studied using the interventionist framework of causal explanation. Lynch and colleagues advocate a methodological reductionism in order to achieve stronger causal explanation by improving the specificity, stability and proportionality of the causal relationship (Lynch, Parke, & O’Malley, 2019). Attah and colleagues agreed but indicated that in some cases a more coarse-grained, less specified explanation is preferable (Attah, DiMarco, & Plutynski, 2020). However, I argue that in human gut microbiomes studies, mechanistic causal accounts are used to strengthen causal relationship. Looking at the literature on the human gut microbiomes research linked with health outcomes, the published work can be divided into two camps. The first camp investigates single or few microorganisms (often bacteria) isolated from human microbiomes to study their effects both in vitro and in vivo. Researchers there aim to produce a probiotic: a bacterial strain with interesting properties for human health. I argue that despite relying on intervention such as giving the microorganism to mice in order to improve the phenotype of a disease, the causal relationship between the microorganism and the phenotype is strengthen when a mechanism is known or at least hypothesized (e.g., via the decrease of the gut barrier permeability). The second camp explores the role of whole microbiome in healthy and diseased phenotypes. There, the composition of the microbiome is uncovered mainly to be able to infer functions, when functions are not studied first. In her Philosophy of Microbiology (2014), O’Malley argued that functions here are understood in the ‘Cummins causal-role sense’ (p. 147). In this view, the functions of the components contribute to the function of the system containing them. This account can be labelled as mechanistic where functions from components (e.g., bacteria) are transmitted to the function of the system (e.g., whole microbiome). Both camps seem to value mechanistic causation in their explanation of phenotypes. I argue that there are at least two advantages of this account in comparison to the interventionist one. First, steps of the mechanism can be therapeutically targeted. Second, as the second camps analysis seem to show, researchers find relevant to study the whole microbiome and even consider it as causal. Mechanistic account does not suffer from the problem of specificity and proportionality and thus, as long as a mechanism between the whole microbiome and its effect is found, the whole microbiome can be causal. Focusing on the mechanistic account and not only the interventionist account makes more sense of the current state of therapeutic approaches and recent researches in the human gut microbiomes. This paper is a scientific case-study analysed with a philosophical perspective in order to challenge and complete the recent account of causality in microbiomes research.},
